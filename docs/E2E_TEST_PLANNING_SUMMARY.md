## 💡 Key Insights

### About the Game
- Single-device, 2-5 player pass-and-play experience
- Turn-based with simultaneous marking opportunity
- Ends on 2nd row lock OR 4th player penalty
- Complex marking rules (left-to-right, skipping)

### About Testing
- Must test all 5 browser/mobile configurations
- Need to verify game state transitions
- Complex turn flow requires sequence testing
- Scoring calculations must be exact
- UI state changes are critical to test

### About Implementation
- Helper functions critical for code reuse
- Wait states are important (avoid flakes)
- Multiple players means complex scenarios
- Mobile responsive design needs explicit testing

---
