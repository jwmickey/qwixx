## Architecture Highlights

### Component Structure
```
App (GameProvider wrapper)
â”œâ”€â”€ GameSetup (when status = 'setup')
â”œâ”€â”€ GameBoard (when status = 'playing')
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameControls
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DiceDisplay
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ScoreSheet (for each player)
â””â”€â”€ GameSummary (when status = 'ended')
```

### State Management
- React Context + useReducer for global state
- No prop drilling - clean component interfaces
- Direct dispatch from components
- Automatic re-renders on state changes

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- No custom CSS files needed
- Mobile-first breakpoints
- Consistent spacing and colors

## User Journey

### 1. Game Setup
- Select number of players (2-5)
- Enter player names with validation
- Click "Start Game"

### 2. Gameplay
- Active player rolls dice
- View available combinations
- Mark numbers on score sheet
- Add penalties as needed
- Pass turn to next player

### 3. Game End
- Triggered by 2 locked rows OR 4 penalties
- Winner announcement
- Detailed score breakdown
- Option to start new game

## Validation & Error Handling

### Setup Validation
- Minimum 2 players required
- Maximum 5 players allowed
- Empty names not allowed
- Duplicate names not allowed
- Clear error messages displayed

### Gameplay Validation
- Dice must be rolled before marking
- Numbers must be marked left-to-right
- Cannot mark skipped numbers
- Cannot mark on locked rows
- Cannot exceed 4 penalties

## Animation Details

### Transitions Implemented
- **Dice**: 300ms opacity/scale for locked state
- **Numbers**: 200ms scale (1.05x) on mark, hover effects
