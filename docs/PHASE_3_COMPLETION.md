- Build succeeds without errors
- Linting passes without warnings

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Tested Viewports
- ‚úÖ 320px (minimum supported)
- ‚úÖ 375px (mobile portrait)
- ‚úÖ 768px (tablet)
- ‚úÖ 1024px+ (desktop)

### Responsive Features
- Flexible card widths

- Stacked layout on mobile
- Centered content with max-width on desktop
- Touch-friendly button sizes throughout

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Organization
- Atomic components for reusability (`DiceDisplay`, `ScoreSheet`, etc.)
- Container component (`GameBoard`) for game logic
- Presentation components for UI (`GameSetup`, `GameSummary`)
- Centralized state management via React Context

### State Integration
- Components connect to game state via `useGame()` hook
- Dispatch actions directly from components
- No prop drilling - clean component tree
- State updates trigger automatic re-renders

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS utility classes throughout
- Consistent color palette matching game theme
- Responsive utilities for mobile-first design
- Minimal custom CSS (only index.css base styles)

## Known Limitations

### Deferred Features (Not Critical for MVP)
- Dice roll animations
- Number marking animations

These features enhance visual appeal but are not necessary for functional gameplay. They can be added in Phase 6 (Future Enhancements) if desired.
