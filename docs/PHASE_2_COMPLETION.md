# Phase 2 Completion Report

## Overview

Phase 2 (Core Game Logic) has been completed successfully. This document provides a detailed breakdown of what was already implemented versus what was added to complete the phase.

## Status Summary

All 20 Phase 2 tasks are now complete:
- **2.1 Game State Management**: 5/5 complete (previously done)
- **2.2 Score Sheet Logic**: 6/6 complete (previously done)
- **2.3 Dice Rolling System**: 4/4 complete (3 added, 1 verified)
- **2.4 Game Flow**: 4/4 complete (2 added, 2 verified)

## Phase 2.1: Game State Management (Previously Complete)

All tasks in this section were implemented in previous commits:

✅ **Design game state data structure**
- `GameState` interface with players, dice, locked rows, game status
- Type-safe action definitions
- Located in `src/types/game.ts`

✅ **Implement player management**
- `Player` interface with score sheet, penalties, total score
- `createPlayer()` helper function
- Player ID generation system

✅ **Create turn management system**
- `currentPlayerIndex` tracking
- `NEXT_TURN` action to cycle through players
- Turn-based dice clearing

✅ **Implement game initialization**
- `INITIALIZE_GAME` action
- Player count validation (2-5 players)
- Player name validation

✅ **Add game state validation**
- `validateGameState()` function
- `validatePlayerCount()` function
- `validatePlayerNames()` function
- Comprehensive validation in `src/utils/validation.ts`

## Phase 2.2: Score Sheet Logic (Previously Complete)

All tasks in this section were implemented in previous commits:

✅ **Create score sheet data model**
- `ScoreSheet` interface with 4 colored rows
- `ColorRow` interface with numbers, marks, and locked state
- `MarkedNumber` interface for individual numbers

✅ **Implement number marking logic**
- `MARK_NUMBER` action in game reducer
- Number marking updates score sheet state
- Automatic score recalculation

✅ **Add marking validation (left-to-right, no going back)**
- `canMarkNumber()` function
- Validates marked numbers are to the right of rightmost marked number
- Prevents marking already marked numbers
- Prevents marking on locked rows

✅ **Implement row locking mechanism**
- `canLockRow()` function
- Requires 5+ marks to lock
- Can only lock by marking last number (2 or 12)
- Automatically locks row when conditions met
- Updates locked rows list

✅ **Create penalty mark system**
- `ADD_PENALTY` action
- Penalty tracking (0-4 penalties)
- Automatic score adjustment (-5 per penalty)
- Game end detection at 4 penalties

✅ **Build score calculation algorithm**
- `calculateRowScore()` function using formula n × (n + 1) / 2
- `calculateTotalScore()` function
- Automatic score updates on mark/penalty actions
- Handles penalties in total score

## Phase 2.3: Dice Rolling System (Completed in This PR)

### Previously Complete (Verified)
✅ **Implement colored die removal when row is locked**
- Locked rows tracked in `GameState.lockedRows`
- Dice state stores all six dice values
- Logic in place to check locked rows

### Newly Implemented
✅ **Implement dice roll randomization**
- Created `src/utils/diceHelpers.ts`
- `rollDie()` - Rolls single die (1-6)
- `rollAllDice()` - Rolls all six dice at once
- Random number generation for fair dice rolls

✅ **Create dice combination calculator**
- `getActivePlayerCombinations()` - Calculates all valid combinations for active player
  - White dice sum (available to all)
  - White die 1 + each colored die
  - White die 2 + each colored die
  - Excludes combinations from locked rows
- `getOtherPlayerCombinations()` - Only white dice sum for non-active players
- `getPossibleSums()` - Gets unique sums from dice state

✅ **Add valid move detection based on dice rolls**
- Combination calculator determines valid sums
- Color-specific combinations tracked
- Integration with existing `canMarkNumber()` validation

## Phase 2.4: Game Flow (Completed in This PR)

### Previously Complete (Verified)
✅ **Implement turn sequence**
- `NEXT_TURN` action cycles through players
- Current player index tracking
- Dice cleared between turns

✅ **Create game end detection**
- `shouldGameEnd()` function
- Detects 2+ locked rows
- Detects any player with 4 penalties
- Automatic game status update to 'ended'

### Newly Implemented
✅ **Add active player vs. other players logic**
- `getActivePlayerCombinations()` for active player (all dice)
- `getOtherPlayerCombinations()` for other players (white dice only)
- Distinction properly implements game rules

✅ **Implement winner determination**
- Created `determineWinner()` function
- Returns player(s) with highest score
- Handles ties (multiple winners)
- Works with negative scores
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Test Coverage

### New Test Files
- `src/utils/diceHelpers.test.ts` - 9 tests
  - Tests dice rolling randomization
  - Tests combination calculations
  - Tests locked row handling
  - Tests active vs. other player logic

### Updated Test Files
- `src/utils/gameHelpers.test.ts` - Added 5 tests for winner determination
  - Tests single winner
  - Tests ties
  - Tests edge cases (no players, negative scores)

### Test Results
```
Test Files: 5 passed (5)
Tests: 94 passed (94)
```

All tests pass successfully with 100% success rate.

## Code Quality

### Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Vite build successful
✅ No warnings or errors

### Linting
✅ ESLint passes with no errors
✅ Code follows project style guidelines
✅ Proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Architecture Decisions

### Dice System Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Dice logic separated into dedicated `diceHelpers.ts`
- **Rule Implementation**: Active vs. other players properly distinguished
- **Locked Row Handling**: Dice combinations respect locked rows
- **Deterministic Sums**: Avoids duplicate sums when white dice are equal

### Winner Determination
- **Tie Handling**: Returns array to support multiple winners
- **Simplicity**: Simple max score comparison
- **Extensibility**: Can be enhanced for tiebreakers in future

### Testing Strategy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All new functions fully tested
- **Edge Cases**: Tests cover ties, empty arrays, negative scores
- **Randomness**: Dice rolling tested across multiple iterations
- **Integration**: Existing integration tests verify system cohesion

## Files Modified

### New Files
