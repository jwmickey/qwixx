## Technical Details

### Code Statistics
- **New Components:** 3 files, 408 lines
- **Modified Components:** 9 files
- **New Tests:** 1 file, 7 tests
- **Documentation:** 2 files, 585 lines
- **Total Test Coverage:** 104 tests passing

### Architecture Decisions

**1. localStorage over sessionStorage**
- Persists across browser sessions
- User can resume after closing app
- Standard web practice for game state

**2. Action Replay for UNDO**
- Already implemented in Phase 4.1
- Consistent with existing architecture
- Easy to reason about

**3. Component-based Modals**
- Reusable modal patterns
- Accessible by design
- Easy to maintain and extend

**4. Context-based Auto-Save**
- Non-intrusive integration
- Leverages existing state management
- Minimal performance impact

### Performance Considerations

**Auto-Save:**
- Triggers on state change (React useEffect)
- Minimal serialization overhead
- Only during gameplay (not setup/end)
- Can be disabled by user

**localStorage:**
- Synchronous operations (acceptable for game state size)
- Error handling prevents crashes
- Graceful degradation if quota exceeded

**Component Rendering:**
- Modals render only when open
- Conditional rendering prevents waste
- No unnecessary re-renders
