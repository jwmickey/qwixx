## 📈 Test Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Setup (Priority High)
- [ ] Read: E2E_TEST_PLAN.md - Scenario 1
- [ ] Code: Create `e2e/game-setup.spec.ts`
- [ ] Tests: 9 test cases for game initialization
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:pw` passes

### Stage 2: Core Gameplay (Priority High)
- [ ] Read: E2E_TEST_PLAN.md - Scenarios 2-4
- [ ] Code: Create `e2e/dice-rolling.spec.ts`, `e2e/marking-*.spec.ts`
- [ ] Tests: 14 test cases for basic gameplay
- [ ] Verify: Run and validate all pass

### Stage 3: Game Rules (Priority High)
- [ ] Read: E2E_TEST_PLAN.md - Scenarios 5-8
- [ ] Code: Create `e2e/colored-dice.spec.ts`, `e2e/penalties.spec.ts`, `e2e/locking-rows.spec.ts`, `e2e/game-end.spec.ts`
- [ ] Tests: 17 test cases for game rules
- [ ] Verify: Run full suite

### Stage 4: Extended Testing (Priority Medium)
- [ ] Read: E2E_TEST_PLAN.md - Scenarios 9-12
- [ ] Code: Create `e2e/multi-turn.spec.ts`, `e2e/edge-cases.spec.ts`, `e2e/ui-interactions.spec.ts`

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Game Components
- **Score Sheet**: Individual player's marking area (4 colored rows)
- **Dice**: 6 dice total (2 white, 4 colored: red, yellow, green, blue)
- **Turn**: One player's action phase
- **Penalty**: -5 points for failing to mark

### Test Patterns
- **Setup Pattern**: Initialize game with players
- **Action Pattern**: Execute game action (roll, mark, pass)
- **Assert Pattern**: Verify expected result

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Single function/component (vitest)
- **E2E Tests**: Full user journeys (playwright)
- **Regression**: Smoke tests for CI/CD
