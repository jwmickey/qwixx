## New Features Delivered

### 1. Mobile Layout Optimization

**Changes:**
- Removed redundant "Qwixx" title from GameBoard (saves ~60px height)
- Reduced dice size from 64px to 48px (w-16 h-16 → w-12 h-12)
- Changed dice layout to single line with visual separator
- Removed "Dice" heading label
- Reduced spacing between sections (space-y-4 → space-y-3)
- Reduced dice display padding (p-4 → p-3)

**Impact:**
Two-player games now fit vertically on mobile devices (390x844) without scrolling, improving the user experience significantly.

### 2. Progressive Web App Support

**Manifest (`public/manifest.json`):**
```json
{
  "name": "Qwixx Digital",
  "short_name": "Qwixx",
  "description": "Digital recreation of the popular Qwixx dice game",
  "display": "standalone",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "theme_color": "#2563eb",
  "background_color": "#f3f4f6"
}
```

**Service Worker (`public/sw.js`):**
- Caches essential files for offline use
- Network-first strategy with cache fallback
- Automatic cache versioning and cleanup
- Skip waiting for immediate activation

**Install Prompt:**
- Smart install banner appears after 5 seconds
- Only shows once (tracked via localStorage)
- Dismissible by user
- Uses native browser install prompt
- Hidden in standalone mode

### 3. PWA Utilities Module

Created `src/utils/pwa.ts` with:
- `registerServiceWorker()`: Registers service worker on app load
- `setupInstallPrompt()`: Captures beforeinstallprompt event
- `showInstallPrompt()`: Triggers native install dialog
- `isStandalone()`: Detects if app is running in standalone mode

### 4. Enhanced Meta Tags

Updated `index.html` with:
- App description meta tag
- Theme color for browser UI
- Manifest link
- Apple touch icon support
- Improved title

## Technical Details

### Code Statistics

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/GameBoard.tsx` (removed title, adjusted spacing)
- `src/components/DiceDisplay.tsx` (compact layout)
- `src/App.tsx` (PWA integration, install prompt)
- `index.html` (PWA meta tags)

**Files Created:**
- `public/manifest.json` (PWA manifest)
- `public/sw.js` (service worker)
- `src/utils/pwa.ts` (PWA utilities)
- `docs/PHASE_5_SUMMARY.md` (this document)

**Lines Changed:** ~150 lines added/modified

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Service Worker Strategy:** Network-first with cache fallback ensures users always get the latest version while supporting offline play.

2. **Install Prompt Timing:** 5-second delay prevents overwhelming users immediately, and localStorage tracking ensures the prompt only shows once.

3. **Mobile-First Optimization:** Focused on making the most common use case (2-player game) fit perfectly on mobile screens.

4. **Icon Placeholders:** Actual PNG icons should be created with proper graphics tools. SVG placeholders provided for documentation.

### Performance Metrics

**Bundle Size (Production):**
- JavaScript: 222KB (68KB gzipped) - Slight increase due to PWA code
- CSS: 19KB (4.4KB gzipped)
- Total: 241KB (72.4KB gzipped)

**Load Time Improvements:**
- Service worker caches assets for instant subsequent loads
- Offline support enables use without internet connection

### Browser Compatibility

**PWA Features:**
- Chrome/Edge: Full support (install, offline, etc.)
- Safari iOS: Limited support (no install prompt, but add to home screen)
- Firefox: Service worker support, limited install prompt

**Fallbacks:**
- Install prompt gracefully hidden if not supported
- Service worker registration wrapped in feature detection
- App works perfectly without PWA features

## Testing

### Test Coverage

All existing tests continue to pass:
```
✓ 104 tests passing
✓ 6 test files
✓ 0 failures
```

**Test Categories:**
- Unit tests for game logic (utils/)
- Integration tests for game state (state/)
- All tests remain green after Phase 5 changes

### Build and Lint

```bash
npm run lint    # ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
npm run build   # ✅ Success
npm test        # ✅ 104/104 tests passing
```
